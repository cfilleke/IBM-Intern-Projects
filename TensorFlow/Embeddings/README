README for Embeddings Program

# Author: Christopher F. S. Maligec 250 870 443

This program takes about 550 seconds (9 minutes) to run.
In order to obtain this short runtime, the program has been set to work with a vocabulary size of 500 words and word vectors of 20 dimensions.

Files Set-up:
Create a folder for the program that has the following subfolders:
clustering (with subfolders dp, sk, st),
data,
graphs (with subfolders dp, sk, st),
projector (with subfolders dp, sk, st),
src,
timings

Please replace the absolute path, main_path, at the top of main.py and graph_analysis.py with your own absolute or relative path.

Run program by typing `python main.py`

The embeddings can be viewed by uploading the vectors and metadata tsv files (located in the projector folder) at https://projector.tensorflow.org/
You can sphereize the data to see the word vectors better and can also search for a word and see its closest neighbours.
